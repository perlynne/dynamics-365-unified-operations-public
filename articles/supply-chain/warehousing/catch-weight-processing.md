# Catch weight product processing with warehouse management

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]


## Feature exposure

To use warehouse management to process catch weight products, you must use a license configuration key to turn on the functionality. (Go to **System administration \> Setup \> License configuration**. Then, on the **Configuration keys** tab, expand **Trade \> Warehouse and Transportation management**, and select the check box for **Catch weight for warehouse**).

> [!NOTE]
> Both the **Warehouse and Transportation management** license configuration key and the **Process distribution \> Catch weight** license configuration keys must also be turned on. Additionally, in order to set the configuration keys for catch weight, you must also enable the feature using the **Feature management workspace**. The main feature that needs to be enabled is **“Catch weight product processing with warehouse management”**. There is also another related feature that you may want to optionally enable. This feature is **“Inventory status changes for catch weight products”** and it adds support for changes to inventory status for catch weight-enabled products.
After the license configuration key is turned on, when you create a released product, you can select **Catch weight**. You can also associate the released product with a storage dimension group that the **Use warehouse management processes** parameter is selected for.

Before you can use the product in Warehouse management, you must do some basic product-specific setup for catch weight:

- Define the nominal weight conversion between the catch weight unit (box) and the inventory unit (kilogram \[kg\]) as part of a unit conversion definition.
- Define the minimum and maximum weight tolerances as part of the catch weight unit setup.
- Set up a unit sequence group where the catch weight unit is defined as the lowest stock keeping unit (SKU).
- Set up a catch weight item handling policy.

For more information, see [Setting up and maintaining catch weight items](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamicsax-2012/appuser-itpro/setting-up-and-maintaining-catch-weight-items).

## Transaction adjustments

Because the weight of inventory when it comes into a warehouse can differ from the weight when the inventory is issued out of the warehouse, the catch weight product processing must adjust the inventory. Note: Mobile device activity will only trigger these transaction adjustments if the item’s catch weight item handling policy has an Outbound weight variance method of “Allow weight variance”.

**Example 1**

During a **Report as finished** production process, the inbound weight of a license plate that contains eight boxes of a catch weight product is captured as 80.1 kg. The license plate is then stored away in the finished goods area, and during the storage period, some weight is lost into the air.

Later, as part of a sales order picking process, the weight of the same license plate is captured as 79.8 kg. Therefore, in the system, you now have a weight difference as part of the physical dimension set.

In this case, the system automatically adjusts the difference by posting a transaction for the missing 0.3 kg.

**Example 2**

In its definition, a product is set up to tolerate a minimum weight of 8 kg and a maximum weight of 12 kg for the **Box** catch weight unit.

You have two boxes of the product, and they have a registered weight of 16 kg. If a warehouse worker picks and weighs one of the boxes, and the weight is captured as 9 kg, the remaining box will weigh 7 kg. However, because 7 kg is below the minimum weight, the system does an automatic adjustment to increase the weight of the on-hand inventory by 1 kg.

To set up the accounts that these adjustments are posted to, go to **Cost management \> Ledger integration policies setup \> Posting**. Then, on the **Inventory** tab, define the following accounts:

- Catch weight loss account
- Catch weight profit account

## Catch weight item handling policy

The catch weight item handling policy defines two primary warehouse management flows for the items: when the weight of the items is captured, and how it's captured.

You can define when the weight is captured for sales and transfer order processing. The weight can be captured during either of the following processes:

- **Picking** – The weight is captured during the initial pick work lines of order work.
- **Packing** – The weight is captured during manual packing. (You must send the items to a packing station.)

If the actual weight is captured at the packing station during the container packing processes, warehouse workers won't be prompted to capture the weight during picking work. Instead, the average weight of the physical inventory will be used as the weight of the picked inventory that goes to the packing area. This concept is also applicable for tag tracked catch weight items. For tagged items, these parameters drive when the tag is captured with options being at picking time using the mobile device or during manual packing.

For internal warehouse management processes like counting and adjustment corrections it is possible to define if the weight should be captured or not. If not captured the nominal weight will be used. Other options include capturing weight “Per catch weight unit” or “Per counting quantity”.

You can also define how the weight is captured. In one of the two main flows, catch weight tags are tracked and used to capture the weight. In the other flow, catch weight tags aren't tracked.

- **Yes** – The item uses catch weight tags. Each tag number represents one catch weight unit (box), and a weight and other information are associated with the tag. For outbound processes, the weight that is associated with the tag is used.
- **No** – The item doesn't use catch weight tags. The inbound and outbound weighing processes are based on the actual weight that is captured during each process.

The process of tracking catch weight tags can be used for items that won't change weight during the storage period. The weight will be captured only during the inbound warehouse process. During the outbound process, the catch weight tags will just be scanned, and the weights that are associated with the tags will be used for the outbound transactional processing.

Another important parameter related to catch weight tag processing is the **Catch weight tag dimension tracking method**. A given tag can be partially tracked which means the tag will track product dimensions, tracking dimensions and inventory status. Alternatively, a given tag can be fully tracked which means the tag will track product dimensions, tracking dimensions and ALL storage dimensions.  
Additionally, when an item is tag tracked, there is an option to determine the **Outbound tag capturing method**. Options for this parameter include to either always prompt for the tag on outbound transactions from the mobile device or only prompt for tags when needed. For example, if there are five catch weight tags in inventory on a given license plate and you have indicated that you want to pick all five tags from the license plate, the option of **Only prompt for tag when needed** will automatically pick the five tags without requiring you to scan each tag. If this option is set to **Always prompt for tag**, then even if all 5 tags are being picked, each tag will need to be scanned.

Note: Tags are captured and updated only from the mobile device menu items. There are a few select scenarios where tags are captured elsewhere (for example, from the manual packing station) but if tags are in use, the mobile device menu items should be used in general for all warehouse activity.


### How to capture catch weight

__When catch weight tag tracking is used__, a tag must always be created for every catch weigh unit that is received, and every tag must always be associated with a weight.

For example, **Box** is the catch weight unit, and you receive one pallet of eight boxes. In this case, eight unique catch weight tags must be created, and a weight must be associated with each tag. Depending on the inbound catch weight tag, either the weight of all eight boxes can be captured, and the average weight can then be distributed to each box, or a unique weight can be captured for each box.

__When catch weight tag tracking isn't used__, the weight can be captured for each dimension set (for example, for each license plate and tracking dimension). Alternatively, the weight can be captured based on an aggregated level, such as five license plates (pallets).

For the methods for capturing outbound weight, you can define whether the weighing is done for each catch weight unit (for example, per box) "Per catch eright unit", or whether the weight is captured based on the quantity that will be picked (for example, three boxes) "Per picking quantity". Note that for the production line picking and internal movement processes, the average weight will be used if the **Not captured** option is used.

There are multiple weight capturing methods defined on the catch weight item handling policy. Each parameter is utilized by various transactions. The following summarizes which weight capturing method parameter(s) are used by which transactions:

**Outbound weight capturing method**            Sales picking, Transfer picking
**Production picking weight capturing method**  Production picking, Production consumption
**Movement weight capturing method**            Movement
**When to capture correction of weight**        Adjustments, Counting
**Counting weight capturing method**            Counting
**Warehouse transfer weight capturing method**  Warehouse transfer


To restrict the warehouse management picking processes from capturing weights resulting in catch weight profit/loss adjustments, the Outbound weight variance method can be used. The Outbound weight variance method comes into play during the following mobile device processes: sales picking, transfer picking, production picking, movements, counting and warehouse transfer. Restrict weight variance option can be used if the weight of the catch weight item does not fluctuate during warehouse storage and catch weight profit/loss adjustments are not needed. Allow weight variance option can be used if the weight can fluctuate and if the catch weight profit/loss adjustments are needed when a weight fluctuation is recorded.

## Unsupported scenarios

Not all workflows support catch weight product processing with warehouse management. The following restrictions currently apply. These are for all catch weight items regardless if tagged or not.
 
### Configuring catch weight products for warehouse management processes

- Only formula processing is supported for catch weight products (not bill of materials).
- Catch weight products can't be associated with a tracking dimension group by using the Owner dimension.
- Catch weight products can't be used as services.
- Catch weight products can be used as "stocked products" only as part the item model group.
- Catch weight products can't be used together with the functionality for tracking "Active in sales process."
- Catch weight products can't be used together with the functionality for capturing serial numbers. Therefore, products can't be transferred from a "blank" to a serial number as part of the picking/packing process.
- Catch weight products can't be used together with the functionality for registering serials before consumption.
- Catch weight products that are variant-enabled can't be used together with the functionality for converting variant units of measure.
- Catch weight products can't be marked as a retail "product kit."
- Catch weight products can be used only with a unit sequence group that has catch weight handling units, and that has the catch weight unit as the lowest sequence.
- For catch weight products, the inventory unit can be converted to the catch weight unit only if the conversion produces a nominal quantity that is more than 1.
- The setup of bar codes for catch weight products doesn't support a variable weight setup.
 
### Order processing

- The creation of advance ship notice (ASN/packing structures) doesn't support weight information.
- The order quantity must be maintained based on the catch weight unit.
 
### Inbound warehouse processing

- Receiving license plates requires that weights be assigned during registration, because weight information isn't supported as part of the advance ship notice. When catch weight tag processes are used, the tag number must be manually assigned per catch weight unit.
 
### Inventory and warehouse operations

- Manual creation of quarantine orders isn't supported for catch weight products.
- Manual movement of inventory that is related to open work isn't supported for catch weight products.
- License plate loading to initialize warehouse stock isn't supported for catch weight products.
- Batch balancing processes aren't supported for catch weight products.
- Handling of negative physical inventory isn't supported for catch weight products.
- Inventory marking can't be used for catch weight products.
 
### Outbound warehouse processing

- The functionality for cluster picking isn't supported for catch weight products.
- Pick and pack warehouse processing isn't supported for catch weight products.
- For catch weight products, work that is defined in a work template can be run automatically.
- For catch weight products, manual packing station processing where work is created after containers are closed isn't supported.
- The functionality for pcs-by-pcs scanning isn't supported for catch weight products.
 
### Production processing

- For catch weight products, only batch orders for formula products are supported.
- Kanban functionality isn't supported for catch weight products.
- For catch weight products, serial numbers can't be registered before consumption.
- The functionality for reversing license plates from production isn't supported for catch weight products.
- For catch weight products, reporting as finished cannot be registered by serial number.

### Transportation management processing

- Load building workbench processing isn't supported for catch weight products.
- Transport request lines aren't supported for catch weight products.
 
### Other restrictions and behaviors for catch weight product processing with warehouse management

- During picking processes where the user isn't prompted to identify tracking dimensions, the weight assignment is done based on the average weight. This behavior occurs when, for example, a combination of tracking dimensions is used in the same location and, after a user processes picking, only one tracking dimension value is left in the location.
- When inventory is reserved for a catch weight product that is configured for warehouse management processes, the reservation is done based on the minimum weight that is defined, even if this quantity is the on-hand last handling quantity. This behavior differs from the behavior for items that aren't configured for warehouse management processes. There is one exception to this restriction. For production picking, when picking the last handling quantity of a serial number controlled catch weight product, the actual weight is used.  
- Processes that use the weight as part of capacity calculations (wave thresholds, work maximum breaks, container maximums, location load capacities, and so on) don't use the actual weight of the inventory. Instead, the processes are based on the physical handling weight that is defined for the product.
- In general, Retail functionality isn't supported for catch weight products.
-	Updating inventory status from “Warehouse status change” is not supported for catch weight products.
 
### Catch weight tags

A catch weight tag can either be created using a warehousing app process, manually created in the form, or created using a data entity process. If a catch weight tag is associated with an inbound source document line, such as purchase order line, the tag will be registered. If the line is used for outbound processing. The tag will be updated as shipped.
In addition to the restrictions currently in place with catch weight products, tagged catch weight products have other restrictions that currently apply.

- All manual updates to inventory (not using a mobile device) must include manual corresponding updates to the associated catch weight tags as these updates are not performed automatically.
-	Mixed licensing place receiving is not currently supported for tagged catch weight items.
-	The processing of sales return order receiving can record catch weight tags, but the process will not validate that the returned tag was the same tag that was originally shipped for a particular sales order.
-	The mobile device menu item with Activity code of “Register material consumption” does not currently support recording catch weight tags.
-	Counting processes are supported for tagged catch weight items but limited. For example, you can use the Mobile device options for counting for tagged catch weight items and average weight will be used, but catch weight tags are not automatically updated by the counting transaction. The catch weight tags will need to be manually updated to reflect the inventory after the counting transaction. If items are counted into a location that were not originally in that location, the nominal weight is used.
-	License plate consolidation does not currently support tagged catch weight items.
-	Reverse work functionality is not supported for tag number tracked catch weight items.

Note: The above documentation for catch weight tags is valid If the catch weight product has a catch weight tag dimension tracking method that is fully tracked, meaning that the Catch weight item handling policy parameter **Catch weight tag dimension tracking method** is set to “Product dimensions, tracking dimensions and all storage dimensions”. If the catch weight item is only partially tag tracked, meaning that the **Catch weight item handling policy** parameter “Catch weight tag dimension tracking method” is set to “Product dimensions, tracking dimensions and Inventory Status”, additional restrictions are in place because visibility is lost between the tag and inventory and therefore, some additional scenarios cannot be supported.
